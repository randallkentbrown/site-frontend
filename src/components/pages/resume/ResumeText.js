        `I've been lucky enough to work at two wonderful companies since beginning to study software engineering.`,
        `The first, ENSCO Avionics, located in Binghamton, NY, gave me my first real experience working on a software team.`,
        `It also gave me a rock-solid and thorough education in requirement testing and documentation,`,
        `plus some highly specific aviation verification knowledge which isn't particularly useful day-to-day.`,
        `At my second co-op, I worked with Amplify Education in Brooklyn, NY to develop and test shared user-facing frontends for educational software.`,
        `At Amplify I wrote my first production code and put hundreds of work-hours into automated test development and acceptance testing.`,
        `My current programming project is the refactoring and extension of the LenelS2 Camera Simulator, which is used by LenelS2 test engineers`,
        `to verify the functionality of security system software without a mound of expensive camera hardware.`,
        `I'm working on the Camera Simulator with a wonderful team and I hope to exceed the expectations of my project sponsors.`,
